# Crop-Recommendation-Model
As a participant in the IntelÂ® AI For Youth Program, I conceptualized and developed this project.

This is a basic AI-based project. The AI domain used in this project is data. It helps farmers by recommending crops they can grow in a particular soil type, weather condition and rainfall.
